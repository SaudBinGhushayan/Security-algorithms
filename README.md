# Security-algorithms
In this repo I'm going to post algorithms that are related to security 

-----------------
## MI : Multiplicative inverse 
- This algorithm compute the multiplicative inverse of any number using EEA (Extended Euclidean Algorithm) 
- This algorithm takes two parameters your value and the Z value respectively 
- You can run this algorithm fast using CMD on Windows or Terminal in (MACOS or Linux) by navigating to the directory of the file and then type python on **windows** or ipython on **MACOS** (note: in order to run it on mac you need to have the ipython shell)

## Columnar algorithm
- This is one of the cryptography algorithms that encrypts and decrypts word of your choice 
- You can change the keyword and the plaintext from within the notebook code (there's no paramaters)
